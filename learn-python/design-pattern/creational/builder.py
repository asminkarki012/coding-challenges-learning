    What ?
-> lets you construct complex object step by step,allowing you to produce different types and representations of an object.

 Why is it needed?
Problem:
Creating complex objects with many parameters leads to long, confusing constructors, numerous overloads, and error-prone initialization.

Solution:
The Builder pattern separates object construction into clear, step-by-step methods in a builder class, allowing flexible, readable, and safe creation of complex objects without constructor overload.


Implementation:
Lunch Builder Example with:
- Custom Pizza Builder
- Custom Burger Builder
